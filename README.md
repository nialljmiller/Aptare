# Aptare - Generic Light Curve Fitting Package

Aptare is a versatile and user-friendly Python package designed to fit light curves using various models and techniques. It allows researchers and data analysts to accurately model and fit light curves from a wide range of sources, including astronomical data, sensor data, and more. Aptare provides functionality for fitting different types of light curves, including spline fits, sinusoids, trapeziums with various rise shapes, and Gaussian Processes (GP) with squared exponential kernels.

## Features

Aptare offers the following key features:

- **Spline Fits:** Aptare can fit light curves using splines, both binned and unbinned. Splines are useful for capturing smooth and flexible representations of light curve data.

- **Sinusoid Fits:** Aptare can model periodic phenomena using sinusoidal functions. This feature is particularly useful when analyzing light curves with periodic patterns, such as those arising from celestial objects.

- **Trapezium Fits:** Aptare allows fitting trapezium-shaped light curves with different rise shapes, such as linear, tanh, and sigmoid. Trapezium fits are valuable for studying transient events and quick variations in light intensity.

- **Gaussian Processes (GP):** Aptare supports fitting light curves using Gaussian Processes with squared exponential kernels. GP models provide a powerful framework for capturing complex correlations and uncertainties in the data.

## Getting Started

To get started with Aptare, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Install Aptare using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install aptare
   ```

2. **Usage:** Import Aptare in your Python script or notebook and use the appropriate functions to fit your light curves:

   ```python
   from aptare import spline_fit, sinusoid_fit, trapezium_fit, gp_fit

   # Example: Fit a light curve using a spline
   x_data = [...]  # Your x-axis data (e.g., time)
   y_data = [...]  # Your y-axis data (e.g., intensity)
   spline_fit_result = spline_fit(x_data, y_data)

   # Example: Fit a periodic light curve using a sinusoid
   period = 2.0  # Period of the sinusoidal pattern
   sinusoid_fit_result = sinusoid_fit(x_data, y_data, period)

   # Example: Fit a trapezium-shaped light curve with a specific rise shape
   rise_shape = 'Tanh'  # Can be 'Tanh', 'Sigmoid', or 'Linear'
   trapezium_fit_result = trapezium_fit(x_data, y_data, rise_shape)

   # Example: Fit a light curve using Gaussian Processes with squared exponential kernel
   gp_fit_result = gp_fit(x_data, y_data)
   ```
